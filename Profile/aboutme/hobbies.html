		<h1> All About My Hobbies </h1>
		<p> I have had many hobbies over the years. Here are a few of them.</p>

		<p> One of my main hobbies is playing Dungeons and Dragons. In seventh grade I was introduced to D&D by my English teacher Mrs. Clark. She say that I liked reading and writing fantasy, so she told me about the D&D club she was creating. I brought the flyer home, my mom approved the form, but told me not to tell my grandma. I attended the first meeting and fell in love with the game. It was 5th Edition. My first character was an elven cleric because the group needed a healer. I still have the set of blue dice and the blue graphpaper notebook Mrs. Clark gave me. That summer her husband hosted a game in the first D&D version. It would have been a TPK if my friend Cyrus had not gotten a wish ring and wished for the power to reverse time. I now have been playing D&D for about 6 years. I own the Doungeon Masters Guide, Monster Manual, and Player Handbook all 5e, aswell as two plastic sets of dice and a metal set. I also have a box of D6s.</p>

		<p> Another big hobby of mine is gaming. I like both the solo and social aspects of video games. My first friends I made here at OTC I met in the Esports room my first semester. I have met a lot of great people and it has been fun to connect over the shared interest. I met my friends Halle and Bret because they decided to take me under their wings and train me to not suck at Super Smash Bros. Halle was very encouraging and good at explaining the controls. Bret on the otherhand, though he was good about explaining the controls, employed a "Beat You Up Until You Figure It Out" teaching method. Before coming to colledge I grew up playing games with my sisters on the Original Xbox and later the 360. I also have many memories of us bringing our Kindle Fires over to neiborhood kids' houses and playing Minecraft Pocket Edition.</p>

		<p> Thirdly, I like to world build, create character, and write. This hobby overlaps with many of my other hobbies, including the two I mentioned before this. I like to sometimes give my Minecraft world lore, and also Doungeons and Dragons is literally a game all around worldbuilding and character creation. I have a world built and a fantasy novel idea that I have been working on for a few years now. I am, however, guilty of being one of those people who lists out all their ideas and never actually writes the book. I have writen a few short things like a page long story inspired by the liminal space photography trend or many poems of varying quality. I have never published any of these things, even informally like posting them online.</p>
